,(1,'Lactose Intolerant','An allergy to dairy products is an autoimmune response and can be fatal, while an intolerance is gastrointestinal reaction to the enzyme, lactose.')
,(2,'Vegetarian','A vegetarian is someone who does not eat meat but will eat foods made from animals. The moral reasoning is that it is OK to consume foods from an animal that do not result in the slaughter or mistreatment of that animal. Due to this reasoning, vegetarians will also generally consume only animal products that have been sourced ethically.')
,(2,'Vegan','Unlike a vegetarian diet, vegans will not consume any animal products, including meats and products derived from animals. While vegetarians choose to avoid meat often due to the treatment of the animals, vegans continue that line of thought but are against the animals being bred and placed in a captive environment for the sole purpose of exploiting their lifestyle for the creation of food. Due to its moral reasoning, veganism is a diet preference, not an allergy or food intolerance to these products. However, a vegan diet can be a good option for someone with a dairy allergy as it is very safe to consume vegan friendly foods.')
,(2,'Paleo','Sometimes referred to as the cave-man diet, paleo is a diet preference, not a diet based on food allergy or intolerance. and revolves around the consumption of high fat and protein and moderate carbohydrates. The moniker comes from following a diet that the cavemen would have consumed, being unprocessed foods that can be harvested or hunted.')

,(2,'Kosher','Keeping kosher is a religious observance that means you avoid foods with pork, some poultry, rabbit, some seafood, cheeseburgers, most ice cream, some fruits, and some yogurts')
,(2,'Halaal','Halaal refers to what is permissible or lawful according to Shariah or Islamic law. It is frequently applied to food and drinks. Muslims must ensure that all foods (particularly processed foods), as well as non-food items such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, are halaal. Frequently, these products contain animal by-products or other ingredients that are not permissible for Muslims to eat or use on their bodies. Foods which are not considered halaal for Muslims include blood and intoxicants such as alcoholic beverages. A Muslim who would otherwise starve to death is allowed to eat non-halaal food if there is no halaal food available. Doubtful things are to be avoided.')
